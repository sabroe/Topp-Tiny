# Topp Tiny Function Library

Topp Tiny Function is an open-source Java library which implements functional utilities.

Currently, addressed is the handling of
[exception aware funcional interfaces](src/main/java/com/yelstream/topp/util/function/ex)
and
[access to object properties](src/main/java/com/yelstream/topp/util/function/access).

_Greetings to all, Morten Sabroe Mortensen_
